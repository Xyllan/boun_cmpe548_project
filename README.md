# A Monte Carlo Algorithm for Cold Start Recommendation

The purpose of this project is to implement the methods proposed by [Yu Rong, Xiao Wen, and Hong Cheng](http://wwwconference.org/proceedings/www2014/proceedings/p327.pdf) at WWW '14, and if possible, extend it. We will be using the [Movie Lens 1M Dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) to test the results of the method, as per the paper.
